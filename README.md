# In this Assignment, I tried with ***React-Redux***

I developed a site that is dedicated to hiring books. Suppose, I got 100 books. I do not read all these books at once! So I decided to help out other brothers and sisters throughout the world by providing books to read!
What you just need to do is to choose which book you want to read and just provide your delivery address. Courier service of course.
You will need to provide the Courier Charge. You will be given 7 days to finish the book. Afterward, you will return the book to my address via Courier service again and you need to pay the charge. If you need extra time to read the book, please inform me via email.
### You do not have to pay any charge for the book hiring! Just the Courier service charge!!!
